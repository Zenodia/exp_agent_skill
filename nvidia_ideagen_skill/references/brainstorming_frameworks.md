# Brainstorming Frameworks Reference

This document provides proven brainstorming methodologies for the NVIDIA Idea Generation Skill.

## Popular Frameworks

### 1. SCAMPER

A creative thinking technique that prompts idea generation through seven lenses:

- **S**ubstitute: What can be substituted?
- **C**ombine: What can be combined?
- **A**dapt: What can be adapted from elsewhere?
- **M**odify: What can be magnified or minimized?
- **P**ut to other uses: What else can this be used for?
- **E**liminate: What can be removed?
- **R**everse: What can be reversed or rearranged?

**Example Application:**
- Original: "Food delivery app"
- Substitute: Drone delivery instead of drivers
- Combine: Meal planning + grocery delivery
- Adapt: Apply Netflix recommendation to meal suggestions
- Modify: Minimize packaging waste
- Put to other uses: Use drivers for local errands too
- Eliminate: Remove physical menus entirely
- Reverse: Let restaurants bid for customer orders

### 2. Six Thinking Hats (Edward de Bono)

Structured approach using six perspectives:

- **White Hat**: Facts and information
- **Red Hat**: Emotions and feelings
- **Black Hat**: Critical judgment and risks
- **Yellow Hat**: Optimism and benefits
- **Green Hat**: Creativity and possibilities
- **Blue Hat**: Process control and organization

**When to Use**: Complex problems requiring multiple perspectives

### 3. TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving)

40 inventive principles including:
- Segmentation
- Taking out/Separation
- Local quality
- Asymmetry
- Merging/Consolidation
- Universality
- Nested doll
- Counterweight
- Preliminary counteraction
- Beforehand cushioning

**Best For**: Technical innovation and engineering challenges

### 4. Design Thinking

Five-stage process:
1. **Empathize**: Understand user needs
2. **Define**: Frame the problem
3. **Ideate**: Generate solutions
4. **Prototype**: Create testable versions
5. **Test**: Gather feedback and iterate

**Application**: User-centered product development

### 5. Mind Mapping

Visual brainstorming technique:
- Central topic in the middle
- Main branches for categories
- Sub-branches for details
- Use colors, images, keywords

**Benefits**: Visual organization, association discovery

### 6. Brainwriting (6-3-5)

Structured group brainstorming:
- 6 participants
- 3 ideas each
- 5 minutes per round
- Ideas build on previous ones

**Advantage**: Equal participation, no dominance

### 7. SWOT Analysis

Strategic planning framework:
- **S**trengths: Internal positive factors
- **W**eaknesses: Internal negative factors
- **O**pportunities: External positive factors
- **T**hreats: External negative factors

**Use Case**: Business strategy and competitive analysis

## Creativity Techniques

### Forced Connections
Randomly combine unrelated concepts:
- Pick two random words/concepts
- Force a connection between them
- Example: "Cloud" + "Restaurant" = Cloud kitchen concept

### Reverse Brainstorming
Instead of "How to solve X?", ask "How to cause X?"
- Reveals hidden assumptions
- Uncovers non-obvious solutions

### Analogical Thinking
Apply solutions from one domain to another:
- How would [company/person] solve this?
- What can we learn from [industry]?

### Random Word Association
Use random words as creativity triggers:
- Generate random word
- Connect it to your problem
- Explore the associations

## Ideation Prompts

### Expansion Prompts
- "What if we made this 10x bigger/smaller?"
- "What if there were no constraints?"
- "What would this look like in 10 years?"

### Challenge Prompts
- "Why does this have to be this way?"
- "What assumptions can we challenge?"
- "What would break if we removed this?"

### Combination Prompts
- "What if we combined X and Y?"
- "How can we apply Z's approach here?"
- "What's the intersection of these concepts?"

## Domain-Specific Approaches

### Technology/Software
- User story mapping
- Feature prioritization matrices
- Technical spike exploration
- Architecture decision records

### Business/Strategy
- Business Model Canvas
- Value Proposition Canvas
- Porter's Five Forces
- Blue Ocean Strategy

### Product Design
- Jobs to Be Done framework
- User journey mapping
- Feature prioritization (RICE, MoSCoW)
- A/B testing hypotheses

### Marketing
- Customer persona development
- Campaign concept boards
- Content pillar strategy
- Channel mix optimization

## Constraints-Based Ideation

### Time Constraints
- "What can we build in 1 week?"
- "What's the MVP?"
- "Quick wins vs long-term vision"

### Resource Constraints
- "With $1000 budget?"
- "With current team only?"
- "Using existing technology?"

### Scope Constraints
- "For this specific user segment?"
- "In this geographic region only?"
- "Solving this one pain point?"

## Divergent vs Convergent Thinking

### Divergent Phase
**Goal**: Generate maximum ideas
- Quantity over quality
- No criticism
- Wild ideas encouraged
- Build on others' ideas

### Convergent Phase
**Goal**: Narrow to best ideas
- Evaluation criteria
- Prioritization
- Feasibility assessment
- Alignment with goals

## Collaborative Brainstorming Rules

1. **Defer Judgment**: No criticism during generation
2. **Go for Quantity**: More ideas = better ideas
3. **Encourage Wild Ideas**: Breakthrough often from extreme
4. **Build on Others**: "Yes, and..." instead of "But..."
5. **Stay Focused**: Keep topic in mind
6. **One Conversation**: Avoid side discussions
7. **Visual Communication**: Draw, sketch, diagram

## Idea Evaluation Criteria

### Innovation Matrix
- **High Value, High Feasibility**: Do now
- **High Value, Low Feasibility**: Investigate
- **Low Value, High Feasibility**: Quick wins
- **Low Value, Low Feasibility**: Discard

### RICE Scoring
- **R**each: How many people affected?
- **I**mpact: How much improvement?
- **C**onfidence: How sure are we?
- **E**ffort: How much work required?

Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

### Impact/Effort Matrix
Simple 2x2 grid:
- High Impact, Low Effort: Do first
- High Impact, High Effort: Strategic projects
- Low Impact, Low Effort: Fill-ins
- Low Impact, High Effort: Avoid

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Premature Criticism**: Kills creativity
2. **Dominance**: One voice drowning others
3. **Groupthink**: Conformity over creativity
4. **Analysis Paralysis**: Over-analyzing instead of generating
5. **Scope Creep**: Losing focus on the problem
6. **Ego-Driven**: Attachment to specific ideas

## Practical Tips

### Before Brainstorming
- Define clear problem statement
- Set time limits
- Gather relevant information
- Choose appropriate framework

### During Brainstorming
- Use timers for focused bursts
- Record all ideas (no filtering)
- Use visual aids
- Take breaks to refresh

### After Brainstorming
- Cluster similar ideas
- Evaluate systematically
- Document decisions
- Create action plans
